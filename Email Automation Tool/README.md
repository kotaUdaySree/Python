### Project Name:
**Personalized Email Automation**

### Project Description:
This project automates the process of sending personalized emails with customized content to multiple recipients. The emails can be sent with different formats (such as HTML) and support adding CC recipients. This can be used for job applications, marketing, or customer outreach, with the ability to customize content dynamically (such as recipient names, job details, etc.).

### Key Features:
- **Customizable email content** with dynamic data (e.g., recipient names).
- **Support for HTML email format** to allow rich content (e.g., styling, links).
- **CC functionality** to send emails to additional recipients.
- **SMTP email sending** using Gmail's SMTP server (can be adapted for other email providers).
- **Easy to configure**: Customize email subjects, bodies, and recipients.

### Technologies Used:
- Python
- SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)
- HTML

### Additional Improvements:
- Implement **error handling** for failed email sends.
- Add **file attachments** if needed (e.g., for sending resumes or reports).
- Use **templates** for email bodies, making it easy to manage and scale.
